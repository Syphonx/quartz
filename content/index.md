# What is this?

This is a collection of my personal notes I've gathered over the course of my career as a programmer in the games industry.

> [!warning]
> I am in the process of slowly converting all of my notes from ramblings into a usable and âœ¨ readable âœ¨ format

# How to navigate

The layout is subject to change over time so i wouldn't recommend hard-linking to any specific page. 

## Navigation
> Organised and tagged development resources

## Snippets
> Nuggets of information, organised by context

## Unreal Engine
> Learning resources, breakdowns, notes & more!
